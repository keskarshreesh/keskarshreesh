I am a software developer (fullstack) with a demonstrable history of working with technologies like ReactJS, Spring Boot, Java, Kafka and Oracle SQL. I'm also familiar with cloud application deployment techniques, Docker, Kubernetes and microservices architecture.
I also have a keen interest in applied Machine/Deep Learning, specifically with regards to Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. During my undergrad, I have completed two semester long research internships at IISc Bangalore and Macquarie University, Sydney, wherein I did extensive work in theorizing and running experiments with large scale Deep Learning architectures for Computer Vision.

I am a B.E (Hons) Computer Science and Msc. (Hons) Economics graduate from BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus.
I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at JP Morgan Chase & Co.

Please contact me to discuss any mutual areas of interest or for any relevant opportunities.
